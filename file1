Option 3: Hire/Freelance Developer (while you do infra)

You design infra (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring).

A small freelancer or team builds the React Native + Relay code.

For a 5-user MVP, this can be built in ~4 weeks with 1–2 developers.

You focus on deployments, scaling, infra automation (your strength).
